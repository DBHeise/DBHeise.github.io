      <description>So I was setting up my GOGS internally so my sons could have a place to push code (and so I could host my many never-completed projects) and I ran across an issue with git not liking my certificate on the HTTPS server. Its not self-signed, but it is from my internal CA. This is windows-land so its already trusted (AD CS) by the OS, but apparently not by the default git install.</description>
