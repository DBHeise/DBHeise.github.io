      <title>Being Secure vs Feeling Secure</title>

      <description>There is a big difference between &amp;ldquo;Being Secure&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Feeling Secure&amp;rdquo;. Far too often even security professionals (financial, physical, computer, or any other) lean towards &amp;ldquo;feeling secure&amp;rdquo; rather than actually &amp;ldquo;being secure&amp;rdquo; because &amp;ldquo;being secure&amp;rdquo; is very very hard, if not impossible.
Feeling Secure is a feeling in your gut that you&amp;rsquo;ve done all you can think of and covered every base (that you know about). You have used every little trick you know about, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how or why it works.</description>

      <title>Why I wear a mask</title>

      <description>I do not wear a face mask because it&amp;rsquo;s the law, because it&amp;rsquo;s not a law it&amp;rsquo;s an executive order&amp;hellip;
I do not wear a face mask because it keeps me or you safe from this virus, because it does not and there is quite a bit of scientific discussion about the efficacy of the various types of face masks&amp;hellip;
I do not wear a face mask because someone on TV said so, I don&amp;rsquo;t care what supposed celebrity X says about anything really&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So far this year we&amp;rsquo;ve had a wild ride with all kinds of crazy. I&amp;rsquo;m often thinking about how &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; are going to get out of this mess. I&amp;rsquo;ve never hidden my religious beliefs, but I tend to keep quiet about everything. But I&amp;rsquo;m trying to speak up about &amp;lsquo;stuff&amp;rsquo; more&amp;hellip;but you might not like it.
So here&amp;rsquo;s what I think about the events of today&amp;hellip;There is only one solution to our problems, its not a politician, its not a political party, its not a school of thought, its not a movement, its not an organization.</description>
