      <description>So far this year we&amp;rsquo;ve had a wild ride with all kinds of crazy. I&amp;rsquo;m often thinking about how &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; are going to get out of this mess. I&amp;rsquo;ve never hidden my religious beliefs, but I tend to keep quiet about everything. But I&amp;rsquo;m trying to speak up about &amp;lsquo;stuff&amp;rsquo; more&amp;hellip;but you might not like it.
