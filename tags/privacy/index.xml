      <description>From Schiener on Security - My Reaction to Eric Schmidt:
Too many wrongly characterize the debate as &amp;ldquo;security versus privacy.&amp;rdquo; The real choice is liberty versus control. Tyranny, whether it arises under threat of foreign physical attack or under constant domestic authoritative scrutiny, is still tyranny. Liberty requires security without intrusion, security plus privacy. Widespread police surveillance is the very definition of a police state. And that&amp;rsquo;s why we should champion privacy even when we have nothing to hide.</description>
