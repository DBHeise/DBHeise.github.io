      <title>Being Secure vs Feeling Secure</title>

      <description>There is a big difference between &amp;ldquo;Being Secure&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Feeling Secure&amp;rdquo;. Far too often even security professionals (financial, physical, computer, or any other) lean towards &amp;ldquo;feeling secure&amp;rdquo; rather than actually &amp;ldquo;being secure&amp;rdquo; because &amp;ldquo;being secure&amp;rdquo; is very very hard, if not impossible.
Feeling Secure is a feeling in your gut that you&amp;rsquo;ve done all you can think of and covered every base (that you know about). You have used every little trick you know about, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how or why it works.</description>

      <description>I do not wear a face mask because it&amp;rsquo;s the law, because it&amp;rsquo;s not a law it&amp;rsquo;s an executive order&amp;hellip;
I do not wear a face mask because it keeps me or you safe from this virus, because it does not and there is quite a bit of scientific discussion about the efficacy of the various types of face masks&amp;hellip;
I do not wear a face mask because someone on TV said so, I don&amp;rsquo;t care what supposed celebrity X says about anything really&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>so one of the things this blog is going to try to accomplish is collect all the various items that I&amp;rsquo;ve put on various places in the web. This means old school projects/papers/writings/thoughts as well as linking to &amp;amp; copying of content that I&amp;rsquo;ve produced that lives elsewhere on the web.
We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes&amp;hellip;</description>
