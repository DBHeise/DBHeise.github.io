          <p>So far this year we&rsquo;ve had a wild ride with all kinds of crazy. I&rsquo;m often thinking about how &ldquo;we&rdquo; are going to get out of this mess. I&rsquo;ve never hidden my religious beliefs, but I tend to keep quiet about everything. But I&rsquo;m trying to speak up about &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; more&hellip;but you might not like it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I think about the events of today&hellip;There is only one solution to our problems, its not a politician, its not a political party, its not a school of thought, its not a movement, its not an organization. The only solution is Jesus Christ and His teachings.</p>
<p>I want to be clear here, I do not believe that the solution is for Christ to appear, wave His hand, and &ldquo;POOF&rdquo; everything is better (although He could do that :smile: ). This is simply a sophomoric look on reality. What I do mean is that living by His principles and doctrine will solve the problems: &ldquo;love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you&rdquo; <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5?lang=eng#44">Matthew 5:44</a>. There is, of course, more complexity to life, and there are situations, circumstances, and nuances that I&rsquo;m pollyannishly glossing over; but the core answer is the same.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few words from our prophet: <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/president-nelson-shares-social-post-encouraging-understanding-and-civility">https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/president-nelson-shares-social-post-encouraging-understanding-and-civility</a></p>
<p>My favorite quotes from the (above):</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Creator of us all calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children. Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong. Evil has never been resolved by more evil.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We need to foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul, regardless of their color, creed, or cause. And we need to work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;I&rsquo;m certain there will be those that don&rsquo;t understand and those that don&rsquo;t agree. That&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;re still here on earth together. That didn&rsquo;t start this year, but I think perhaps some started to better understand that principle (that we&rsquo;re all here together) because of the events of 2020.</p>
