          <p>So far this year we&rsquo;ve had a wild ride with all kinds of crazy. I&rsquo;m often thinking about how &ldquo;we&rdquo; are going to get out of this mess. I&rsquo;ve never hidden my religious beliefs, but I tend to keep quiet about everything. But I&rsquo;m trying to speak up about &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; more&hellip;but you might not like it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I think about the events of today&hellip;There is only one solution to our problems, its not a politicion, its not a political party, its not a school of thought, its not a movement, its not an organization. The only solution is Jesus Christ and His teachings.</p>

<p>My favorite quotes from the (above):</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Creator of us all calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children. Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong. Evil has never been resolved by more evil.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We need to foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul, regardless of their color, creed, or cause. And we need to work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;I&rsquo;m certian there will be those that don&rsquo;t understand and those that don&rsquo;t agree. That&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;re still here on earth together. That didn&rsquo;t start this year, but I think perhaps some started to better understand that principle (that we&rsquo;re all here together) because of the events of 2020.</p>
