          <p>On 2016-07-15 at 5pm EST <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/">Palo Alto Networks</a> started a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security">Capture the Flag</a> competition with cash prizes called <a href="http://www.labyrenth.com/">PAN Labyrenth CTF</a>. When I looked at the challenges I noticed that there was a Documents track, and since there was a cash prize to the frist person to complete a given track I thought I&rsquo;d give it a go..hey $1000 for a few hours is not bad. It only took me a few hours (actually more than I intended because I got stuck overthinking one of the problems), but I don&rsquo;t think I was the first one to complete the track. Regardless, I thought I&rsquo;d share the steps I went through to solve each of the challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2016/08/15/2016-Palo-Alto-Labyrenth-CTF-Doc-01/">DOC 01</a> &lt;- You are here</li>

</ul>
<p>So to get starting running the CTF you need the initial code for the DOCs track which is found on the getting started page&hellip;it was <em>PAN{DOCS_START}</em>. Upon entering this you are given a zip file to download (hash: <a href="/data/PAN_CTF_DOCTrack_001.zip">846CBD76B491FD6F74212A4259FE933A0FEBF3E5EA93D24A91241EDCD98D5EDC</a>). This file contains two items, one the first document named challenge.doc (hash:9BBEDADF4A5A9CC75DDA5F4CCE7416BEDD1B2221BF80BF6C3CC73DFEE9A337CD), and the second is a file simply named &ldquo;.7z&rdquo; (hash:B588AAC998556D1F853AD8C3D4D428CEB26B7D38CFD073CC77C82F4C6EF4FA97). We&rsquo;ll come back to this file in a little bit (as it is a shortcut), but let start with the other file &ldquo;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So what do you do first? Open the file in word? Are you a n00b or insane? probably a little of both&hellip;if you&rsquo;re going to go this route, please make sure that you&rsquo;re doing it on a machine you can easily clean and have some sort of network monitoring turned on&hellip;.or a sandbox of somesort.</p>
<p>So you can just open it if you trust the document or know what you&rsquo;re doing&hellip;but don&rsquo;t trust it, are you even sure its actually a document? You need a tool to determine as much as you can without running it&hellip;this is static analysis. Personal I lean on tools that I&rsquo;ve written, but there are lots of great tools out there and I&rsquo;m not trying to steer you away or towards any particular tool&hellip;I&rsquo;m just showing you what I did.</p>
<p>So we run it through my <a href="https://github.com/DBHeise/fileid">FileId</a> tool and get the VBA code out (using the XML or JSON output options). You could also use many other tools, for example: <a href="http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools">OleTools</a> by Philippe Lagadec, or <a href="https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/">OleDump</a> by Didier Stevens. In the end you get this code:</p>
<pre><code>Private Function QklkhFEQNB(HGKuttPaRM As Variant, UBvkWqzieX As Integer)

</code></pre><p>Looking at this code I can see a couple of things that stand out:</p>
<ol>
<li>the QklkhFEQNB function is the string deobfuscation function. You can tell this by its frequency of use and its always called before the string is needed (look for CreateObject)</li>
<li>it does have an autorun functionality (i.e. &ldquo;Document_Open&rdquo;), so if we had opened the file and ran the macros it would have done its business</li>
</ol>
<p>What is its business, well without too much digging we can see that it has a variable named xHttp and xStrm in the BkAIuNwQNDkohBY function and we can see that there is a Shell command. Often variable names are also obfuscated in malicious documents so the fact that they aren&rsquo;t kind of stands out. So it downloads something, saves it to disk, and executes it.</p>
<p>So first things first we want to see to where it calls home. To accomplish this we have the deobfuscation function in VBA, so lets open M$Word, create a new document, open up the VBA Editor and drop it in.</p>
<p>If you do this you will see that it won&rsquo;t quite work that simply. If you look carefully at the deobfuscation function you&rsquo;ll notice it references a document variable:</p>
<pre><code>ActiveDocument.Variables(&quot;ppKzr&quot;).Value()
</code></pre><p>and in the Document_Open subroutine it references this same variable and sets it to &ldquo;toto&rdquo;. Knee-jerk reaction replace that with the static string &ldquo;toto&rdquo;&hellip;.nope won&rsquo;t work, remember the way the code is written it must NOT be &ldquo;toto&rdquo; at first. So we have a couple of options at this point:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can brute force the value for the &ldquo;ppKzr&rdquo; variable</li>
<li>We can try to look up the value</li>
<li>We can just run it though a sandbox, or something monitoring the network traffic involved</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point I honestly went with option #3 (but we&rsquo;ll come back to the other two options in other documents in this CTF track)&hellip;it was easy and quick.</p>
<p>In the end we have this URL that it tries to call home to (defanged):</p>
<pre><code>hXXp://{REDACTED RFC1918 IPv4}/b64/x58/MDgxOTE2MjMwZTMxMDIzMTNhNjk2YjA3NjgzNjM0MjE2YTJjMzA2ODJiNmIwNzBmMzA2ODA3MTMz\nNjY4MmYwNzJmMzA2YjJhNmI2YTM0Njg2ODMzMjU=/evil.executes
</code></pre><p>well that IP doesn&rsquo;t help us, its a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt">RFC1918</a> (or via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network">Wikipedia</a>) private block&hellip;but hmmm, that blob in the middle looks base64 encoded&hellip;and it even says &ldquo;b64&rdquo; but it also has a 0x58 before the blob&hellip;we&rsquo;ll come back to that. So you run the &ldquo;MDgx&hellip;jU=&rdquo; string through your base64 decoder of choice (I used powershell):</p>
<pre><code>$s1 = &quot;MDgxOTE2MjMwZTMxMDIzMTNhNjk2YjA3NjgzNjM0MjE2YTJjMzA2ODJiNmIwNzBmMzA2ODA3MTMz\nNjY4MmYwNzJmMzA2YjJhNmI2YTM0Njg2ODMzMjU=&quot;
[Convert]::FromBase64String($s1)
</code></pre><p>You run the above and you&rsquo;ll get an error immediate error:</p>
<pre><code>Exception calling &quot;FromBase64String&quot; with &quot;1&quot; argument(s): &quot;The input is not a valid Base-64 string as it contains a non-base 64
character, more than two padding characters, or an illegal character among the padding characters. &quot;
</code></pre><p>Not a valid base64 string?? hmmm&hellip;lets look at that string again&hellip;wait there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;\n&rdquo; in that string&hellip;.ok so we can either take it out or make sure powershell properly escapes it&hellip;just change &ldquo;\n&rdquo; to &ldquo;`n&rdquo; as this is how powershell escapes stuff. So we run it through the base64 decoding function again and it works&hellip;but its just a bunch of bytes&hellip;but wait there all in a small range. Taking a guess that its an ASCII string I&rsquo;ll run this powershell command:</p>
<pre><code>[System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($s1))
</code></pre><p>boom and I get a string (shortened for brevity):</p>
<pre><code>081916230e3102313a696b07683634216...68071336682f072f306b2a6b6a3468683325
</code></pre><p>well that isn&rsquo;t very interesting, but I think I&rsquo;m stil on the right track. Now I need to go back to the 0x58&hellip;hmmm&hellip;I wonder if this an XOR string and perhaps the 0x58 is the key. How would I check this? I&rsquo;ll turn to another tool <a href="http://www.kahusecurity.com/tools/">DataConverter</a> by Kahu Security (of course there are other tools&hellip;)</p>
<p>So I put our string in and mark it as Hex format (looks hex to me), and enter our hex key 0x58 and we get (key is REDACTED for you pleasure):</p>
<pre><code>PAN{_REDACTED_}
</code></pre><p>huh&hellip;PAN{<em>blahblahblah</em>} that looks like the key we entered to get this started&hellip;lets try it out&hellip;</p>
<p>POOF</p>
<p>&hellip;it works and we get doc02</p>
